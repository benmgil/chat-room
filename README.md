Note: The rubric requires that "the chat room displays all users currently in the room." We implemented this within a chat menu - if a user desires to change the recipient of their message (default is "Everyone"), they are able to click on the button that displays a menu of usernames for all users in the room, except for that particular person's username. 

Creative Portion:
1. On the home page, in addition to joining and creating a room, users can now browse a list of currently open rooms and join from there. The list indicates whether or not the room is password protected.
1. Admin can unban users
1. Admin can mute users
1. Admin can unmute users
1. Users/admin can leave a room and return to the home page while staying logged in
1. if everyone leaves a room, it is destroyed
